# SMT Web App
The Stanton-Murillo Transport (SMT) model in web app form.

Ionic transport in high-energy-density matter

```

This python code uses Plotly's Dash library to build a web app based on the SMT model. The original, which is what is here for now, was written by Matt Anikiej. The physics of SMT was originally coded by Luke Stanek. The current goals for this project are to:

* update the SMT library itself to handle plasma mixtures,
* update the UI to expose the mixture capability,
* link the final version into Heroku for the world to use.
